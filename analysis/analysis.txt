Technical Feasibility
Our current knowledge with Node.JS and MangoDB is less than stellar right now. 
This will reduce as we work on the project however it will still mean difficulties at first.
Implementing will take longer than usual because of this as we deal with our own lack of knowledge. 
We hope to use various free resources to improve our skills as we work.

Scheudle 
I think that 10 days should be enough time to create a basic log-in page, since there are very few requirements. 
Hiring another devolper for a project this size would be superflous and an unnecessary cost.

Operatoinal
The easiest lost cost method for learning Node.js or MongoDB, is probably going to be the hardest thing. 
So we would need some type on on boarding for the two languages that we haven't used.
There is probably a fairly large amount of free information online on creating a log-in page.

Economic Feasibility
Provided our budget of 30k we can estimate several cheif costs. 
Firstly our own devolper costs, using standard industry salaries our cost for 10 days comes out to around 6191.78 dollars. 
Next for hosting the sign in page there are two main options, doing it in house or using AWS. 
AWS has a yearly cost of 585 dollars while an inhouse custom system requires a 2k upfront cost and a 60k Sys Admin. 
We decided to use the AWS do to the cost savings in comparison. 
In total we calculated the total cost of 6776.78; 23223.22 dollars below budget.
